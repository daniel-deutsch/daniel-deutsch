### :wave: Hey there, I'm Daniel!

I'm a data scientist with bachelor's in electrical engineering from Universidade de São Paulo and master's in machine learning and finance from Intitute Polytechnique de Paris and Panthéon-Sorbonne.

My passion for data lies in finding and understanding patterns! As you can see from some of my work, I'm quite interested in understanding human behavior through data, such as that available on social media websites. I also enjoy implementing automation projects for daily chores to ease some boring tasks :sweat_smile:.
